for each pixel p(x,y,z) of the screen:
    associate a black color to p
    if the ray (line) that starts at camera and goes towards p intersects any object of the scene then:
        calculate the intersection point to the nearest object
        if there is no object of the scene in-between the intersection point and the light then:
            calculate the color of the intersection point
            associate the color of the intersection point to p
